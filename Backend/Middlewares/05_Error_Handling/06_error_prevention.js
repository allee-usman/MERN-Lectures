/*
To prevent errors, we can perfrom two type of validation:
#1: Client-side form validation
#2: Server-side validation
 
Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.

? We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:

-> We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.

-> We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.

-> We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.
