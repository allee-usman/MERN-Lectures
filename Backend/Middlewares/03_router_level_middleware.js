// Load router-level middleware by using the router.use() and router.METHOD() functions.

//# The following example code replicates the middleware system shown in "02_application_level-middleware.js", by using router-level middleware:

// Set the view engine to EJS
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);

// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use((req, res, next) => {

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path

		next();
	},

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path

	'/user/:id',
	(req, res, next) => {
		//Info: To skip the rest of the routerâ€™s middleware functions, call next('router') to pass control back out of the router instance. i.e:
		// if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router
		if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
		// otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
		else next();
	},
	(req, res, next) => {
		// render a regular page
		res.render('regular.ejs');
	}
);

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
	console.log(`I am special with id: ${req.params.id}`);
	res.render('special.ejs');
