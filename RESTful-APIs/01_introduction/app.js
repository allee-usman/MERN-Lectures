/*
$ A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a set of web service principles that allows systems to communicate over HTTP using standard methods, making it easier to structure, design, and maintain web services. Itâ€™s commonly used in web development to allow servers to handle requests from clients, such as browsers or mobile apps. Also used to perform CRUD operations.

*   CRUD operations:
1.  GET retrieves resources
2.  POST submits new data to server 
3.  PUT updates existing data
4.  PATCH updates existing data partially
5.  DELETE removes data from server

*   Resource-Based: 
    Resources (like users, products, articles) are the key entities in a RESTful API. Each resource is represented by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator), known as an endpoint. For example, a RESTful API managing users might have the following endpoints:

->    GET /users (Fetch all users)
->    POST /users (Create a new user)
->    GET /users/{id} (Fetch a specific user by ID)
->    PUT /users/{id} (Update a specific user)
->    DELETE /users/{id} (Delete a specific user)

*   Stateless Communication:
    RESTful APIs rely on HTTP status codes to communicate the result of a request. Examples:

->    200 OK: Successful request.
->    201 Created: A resource was successfully created.
->    400 Bad Request: The client made an invalid request.
->    404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
->    500 Internal Server Error: A generic server error.

*   JSON/XML Responses: 
    REST APIs typically return data in a structured format like JSON or XML, with JSON being more commonly used today due to its simplicity and easy integration with JavaScript-based applications.
